# pteam-bot

This is a Slack bot that sends a weekly-reminder to myself on current rotations for my church production team. It's built with JavaScript on Google App Script since it utilizes an existing Google Spreadsheet as the database. It's configured on Google App Script to send the reminder once a week on Wednesdays and is updated every 6 hours. 

The weekly-reminder.js contains all those functions. The main.js was supposed to contain other functions like being able to reply when called upon and doing some cool and simple data analytics. That currently is shelved right now due to no "business need".
